# github-oauth-test

Simple Github Oauth Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

But it also requires a tiny server to actually request the access token to Github.

## Server Setup

Get into the server folder and run as follows:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

When it's done, the server will be ready for listening POST requests to `http://localhost:8000/gh-oauth`

## Client Setup

Get into the client folder and run as follows:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

After that, the client will be ready to go at `http://localhost:3000`

Once you're in, you'll be automatically promoted into the login page.

Inside the profile page there is a button in the upper-right corner to logout.

Cheers!
